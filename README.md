Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the discipline of designing,developing,testing and maintaining software systems. 
Importances of software engineering includes:
Enabling innovation: whether its artificial intelligence,cloud computing or mobile apps software engineers design and build the systems that power advancements allowing creation of cutting edge technologies and platforms that drive innovation.
Security: with the growing prevalence of cyber threats, software engineering help in implementing best practices for data encryption, secure coding and system monitoring to protect sensitive information and user privacy.
Sustainability: by creating maintainable and modular systems,engineers can adapt software over time to meet changing requirements or emerging technologies through products that evolve with minimal disruption.
Scalability: software engineering principles ensures that software is designed to scale effectively, accommodating growing user bases and increasing data demands.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.1968 NATO Conference – Introduced the term software engineering to address the software crisis, emphasizing structured development and better project management.
2.1970s Structured Programming – Promoted modular design and control structures, improving software maintainability and reducing chaotic coding practices.
3.2001 Agile Manifesto – Introduced iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility, replacing rigid Waterfall models with Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements Analysis  
Gather and document what the software needs to accomplish, based on user and stakeholder input. This produces a clear set of functional and non-functional requirements,Sets the project’s foundation.
2.System Design- Develop a technical plan, including architecture, data models, and interface designs, to guide how the software will be built-Bridges requirements to actual development.
3. Implementation (Coding) - Write the code to create the software, turning the design into a functional product, often in smaller modules -Builds the working system.
4.Testing-Verify the software works as intended by testing for bugs, functionality, and performance across units, integrations, and the whole system, Ensures quality and reliability.
5.Deployment-Release the software to users, either fully or in stages, including setup and sometimes training, Delivers the product for use.
6.Maintenance-Monitor and update the software after deployment to fix issues, enhance features, or adapt to new needs, Keeps the software effective over time




Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall:  
Linear, sequential process with fixed requirements and heavy documentation.  

Strengths: Predictable, clear milestones. Weaknesses: Inflexible, late delivery.  

Best for: Stable projects like a government tax system or embedded medical device software.

Agile:  
Iterative, flexible process with evolving requirements and frequent delivery.  

Strengths: Adaptable, early feedback. Weaknesses: Less predictable, needs coordination.  

Best for: Dynamic projects like a social media app or a startup’s MVP.

Contrast: Waterfall is rigid and delivers late; Agile is adaptive with incremental results.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software deveoper: a software developer is responsible for writting, testing and maintaining the code that forms the software application. Their responsibilities include: designing and developing software, collaboration, testing code, code reviews, debugging and troubleshooting, documentation and continous improvement of programmes.
Quality assurance engineer: they ensure that the software meets the required standards of quality and is free of defects before it is released to users. Their responsibilities include; testing, automation, identifying bugs, creating test plans and documantation,performance and security testing, verifying requirements and continous improvement.
Project manager: the project manager oversees the planning execution and delivery of software projects ensuring team efficiency and meeting deadlines. their responsibilities include: project planning, coordination and communication, quality control.tracking progress,resource management, risk management,stakeholder management and problem solving.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
