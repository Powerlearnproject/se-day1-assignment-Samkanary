Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the discipline of designing,developing,testing and maintaining software systems. 
Importances of software engineering includes:
Enabling innovation: whether its artificial intelligence,cloud computing or mobile apps software engineers design and build the systems that power advancements allowing creation of cutting edge technologies and platforms that drive innovation.
Security: with the growing prevalence of cyber threats, software engineering help in implementing best practices for data encryption, secure coding and system monitoring to protect sensitive information and user privacy.
Sustainability: by creating maintainable and modular systems,engineers can adapt software over time to meet changing requirements or emerging technologies through products that evolve with minimal disruption.
Scalability: software engineering principles ensures that software is designed to scale effectively, accommodating growing user bases and increasing data demands.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
